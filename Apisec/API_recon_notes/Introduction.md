To target API we must always be able to find them

There are two ways to find API

# Active Reconnaissance
# passive reconnaissance

How An API is used determines How it will be found

APIs meant for consumer use are meant to be easily discovered most especially by using the web applications
By using the web app landing page for API and developer porter pages

targetname.com/api/v1
targetname.come/api/v2

api/targetname/v1

Check github, postman etc.

When searching for Apis in a target use the target website as it was designed

One of the most obvious indicators of an API would be through information gathered using third-Party Sources like Github and API directories.
