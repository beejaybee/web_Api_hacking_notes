Vulnerable to logic flaws
These make it easier for attackers to get access to applications

## Competing challenges
1. Security
    * Secure operation of web interfaces
    * Regular vulnerability testing
    * Rapid review and rremediation findings
2. Privacy
    * Protection of PII, user data
    * Breach notification requirements
    * Massive penalties for violation
3. Accessibility
    * Global push to make data accessible
